A list of ideas for various possible games to have fun making. 


## Game 'types' 
Obviously creating a clone of an exsiting game is a shoddy idea at best. However, below are some game types, that might be neat to create; with DSC flare of course. Under each game 'type' are some of the standouts in that genre. Think about what made those games great and memorible. 

1. Fixed perspective combat
   - Smash Brothers
   - Contra
   - R-Type
   - Gauntlet

2. Racing/Kart
   - Mario Kart
   - Meow Motors
   - Grand Turismo
   - Twisted Metal

3. Fixed Perspective RPG
   - Zelda: A Link to the past
   - Final Fantasy 1 - 9
   - Chrono Trigger

4. 3D RPG
   - Quest 64

5. 2D/3D Platformer
   - Joe &amp; Mac
   - Legend of the mystical ninja
   - Mario (2, 3, 64, 'World 3D')

6. Horror
   - Nightmare Creatures
   - Resident Evil

7. First Person Shooters
   - Apex Legends
   - Tom Clansey's: The Division 2
   - Army of Two

8. Tactical
   - Final Fantasy Tactics
   - Tactics Oger
   - Starcraft

## Game Themes or 'hooks'
Some ideas to tie in to one or more of the game types above.
1. Life/health as a currency
2. Mutli character control (e.g having to control 2 characters back and forth or work together `co-op` to complete puzzels)
3. Proceedural lands/dungeons (with or without seeding).

## Platforms
Where do we want to build? Different platforms have different player bases. Cross-platform, is great for pick-up-and-go between devices but may give certian players an unfair advantage in competitive game types
- mobile
- pc lite
- pc
- console
- cross-platform

## The money talk...
It would be nice to make a game or games that are not only fun, but could provide some regular income. However a lot of games have taken things, like micro-trasactions to stupid levels...
1. A game should never be pay-to-win 
..1. micro-transactions should never give a player an unfair advantage
..2. paying to refill "energy" to be able to play a game is also bull shit.
2. Cosmetics are fine, new skins or exclusives
3. DLC
..1. A games plot should be finished WITHOUT needing to buy DLC to finish a story arc.
4. Arcade friendly additions of certian games might be neat and rekindle a dying industry (arcades).
